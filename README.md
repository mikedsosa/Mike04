Assignment Description

"An anonymous client has recently been hired by BYU and is new to the Provo area. He is also a
foodie. He is looking for a web app that will list out the Top 5 restaurants in the Provo area. As
he is new to the area, he needs the list to be pre-populated with your Top 5 favorite restaurants he
ought to try. The following information should be listed:
• Rank
• Restaurant Name
• Favorite Dish
• Address
• Restaurant Phone #
• Link to Website
Rank, Restaurant Name, and Address all need to be included. The other fields are optional. If
the favorite dish is empty as you prepare to list out the results, list “It’s all tasty!” in its place. If
there is no website entered in the model, we should store as a default “Coming soon.” Once set,
the rank should not be modified (i.e. it should be read only.)
He also wants a page that allows users to submit their own suggestions and to be able to view the
list of suggestions. On this page, we only need to store the:
• Name
• Restaurant Name
• Favorite Dish
• Restaurant Phone #
Check to make sure the phone number is in a valid format (#notcoveredinthevideos).
Make sure to include in your web app:
• Bootstrap Styling
• Navigation between each of the pages
• A welcome page that lists out the Top 5 Restaurants
o An array to store and print out those Top 5 Restaurants
• A page that allows the user to submit their own suggestions
• A page that lists out the suggestions that have been entered by the users
o A List to store and print out those suggestions
• Protection against nulls in the optional fields breaking your program
